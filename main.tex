\section*{Abstract}

Cannabis markets are increasing \cite{Lab Manuel} in both Canada and the US.   In this paper, we analyzed the data set from the publication  \cite{dataset1} and \cite{dataset2} using various methods. This dataset contains the composition of 12 cannabis strains using HPLC-UV. \cite{Lab Manuel, dataset1, dataset2} We first did an ANOVA of different substances in different strains. 
We then used metaboanalyst.ca to do the Pearson Correlation on the dataset. Then we used Python to analyze the dataset using PCA and SAM. We find that ~~~~

\section{Introduction}
\includepdf[scale=0.8, offset=0 -2cm, pagecommand=\section{Materials and Methods} These process are based on \cite{Lab Manuel}. We converted the Excel file into a CSV file.]{main.pdf}
\subsection*{AetaboanAlyst}
We used MetaboanAlyst for the rest of the data analytics.  We used the same dataset as we did in the last section. 


\begin{enumerate}
    \item We uploaded the CSV file to AetaboanAlyst with one var statistical analytics with the data type of concentration and sample of "rows (unpaired)." 
    \item We then skipped the missing value filling.
    \item We then normalized the data with "auto-scaling"
    \item In the statistical analysis model,
